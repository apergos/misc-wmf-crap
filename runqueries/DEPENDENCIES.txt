The explain_sql_query.py script requires the packages python-prettytable, python-mysqldb

All of these scripts require a working MediaWiki installation; for run_sql_query.py and
explain_sql_query.py the script should run on the host with the MediaWiki installation.
For explain_sql_query it should run from a local host (i.e. my laptop) and ssh to
various hosts, including the MediaWiki installed host, to do its work.
