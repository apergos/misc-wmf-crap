Utilities for checking sql queries or sql table structures
for MediaWiki databases.

HOO BOY is there no guarantee of any kind. None whatsoever.
If this eats all of your live AND backup dbs for breakfast,
the only think you'll hear from us is: You Have Been Warned.

These are needed so we can keep track of what different
dumps-relates queries do on different database servers
on different wikis. The queries typically are for some
fields from the revision, page, and possibly text tables,
for some range of pages and/or revisions.
On different servers or wikis, the indices may be different,
the table might have a few extra parameters, etc. So we have
the following:

check_table_structures.py
   compare table structures for a set of wikis on various
   dbs, or across a whole list of wikis, choosing one wiki
   and server as the source of truth for what the listed
   tables should look like

run_sql_query.py
   this is intended for generating output from EXPLAIN
   SELECTs for a file of dump queries, into which some
   standard parameters can be substituted.

run_sql_query.py
   this runs the specified queries, does a SHOW EXPLAIN
   on them while they run, and then shoots them. Some
   standard params can be substituted into the specified
   queries. Use with caution.

genrqsettings.py -- this generates configuration stanzas
   for the runner and explainer for the given wiki.

This is still quite preliminary.
